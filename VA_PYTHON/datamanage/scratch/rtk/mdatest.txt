ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     In addition to the information provided here in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we believe that in order to more fully understand our discussion in this section, you should read our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other disclosures herein, including the discussion of our business and the risk factors.  OVERVIEW OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Historically, we have relied upon sales of our equity securities, borrowings and cash flows from our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing business for working capital. We have a history of significant net losses.  Our primary needs for working capital for the next 12 months related to our Facilities are expected to include costs to operate the Facilities, costs for expansion projects, debt service, and capital investments in the Facilities. Our primary needs for working capital for the next 12 months related to our alternative energy segment are expected to include administrative needs; costs to complete operation and wind-down of the PDU, and to maintain the technology and site; costs to evaluate entry into a new business line and potential investments in a new business line. Based on current market conditions, we expect that the non-expansion activities of our Facilities for the next 12 months can be funded from RNP's cash on hand, RNLLC's and RNPLLC's forecasted operating cash flows and the New 2012 Revolving Credit Facility. We expect to fund our expansion activities through the New 2012 Credit Agreement. We expect to fund our alternative energy segment-related activities during the next 12 months from cash on hand. We may need additional capital in the event we acquire businesses or assets in a new business line or to fund a portion of the costs of the expansion projects. Such additional capital may be available, if needed, from external sources, including from offerings of our or RNP's equity or debt securities and the sale of assets. However, capital markets have experienced extreme uncertainty in recent years, and access to those markets has been difficult. Our failure to raise additional capital if needed would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.  For further information concerning our potential financing needs and related risks, see Part I&#151;Item 1 &#147;Business,&#148; and &#147;Part I&#151;Item 1A &#147;Risk Factors&#148;.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events. Our accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Our critical accounting policies, estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to: revenue recognition, inventories, the valuation of long-lived assets and intangible assets, recoverability of goodwill and the acquisition method of accounting.  Revenue Recognition . We recognize revenue when the following elements are substantially satisfied: when the customer takes ownership from our facilities or storage locations and assumes risk of loss; there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; there is persuasive evidence that an agreement exists documenting the specific terms of the transaction; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Management assesses the business environment, the customer's financial condition, historical collection experience, accounts receivable aging and customer disputes to determine whether collectibility is reasonably assured. If collectibility is not considered reasonably assured at the time of sale, we do not recognize revenue until collection occurs.  Certain product sales occur under product prepayment contracts which require payment in advance of delivery. We record a liability for deferred revenue in the amount of, and upon receipt of, cash in advance of shipment. We recognize revenue related to the product prepayment contracts and relieve the liability for deferred revenue when customers take ownership of products. A significant portion of the revenue recognized during any period may be related to product prepayment contracts, for which cash may have been collected during an earlier period, with the result being that a significant portion of revenue recognized during a period may not generate cash receipts during that period.     49          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements    Natural gas, though not purchased for the purpose of resale, is occasionally sold under certain circumstances. Natural gas is sold when contracted quantities received are in excess of production requirements and storage capacities, in which case the sales price is recorded in revenues and the related cost is recorded in cost of sales.   Inventories . Our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. The cost of inventories is determined using the first-in first-out method. We perform an analysis of our inventory balances at least quarterly to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value. The analysis of estimated net realizable value is based on customer orders, market trends and historical pricing. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated net realizable value, the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated net realizable value. We allocate fixed production overhead costs to inventory based on the normal capacity of our production facilities.  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets. We assess the realizable value of long-lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of our assets, we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. As applicable, we make assumptions regarding the useful lives of the assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.   Recoverability of Goodwill. We test goodwill assets for impairment annually, or more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment may have occurred. The recoverability of goodwill involves a high degree of judgment since the first step of the required impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value. Based on the assumptions underlying the valuation, impairment is determined by estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing that value to the reporting unit's book value. If the fair value is more than the book value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is not recognized. If an impairment exists, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of its assets and liabilities excluding goodwill, with the excess amount representing the fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the book value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of that goodwill.  Accounting for Major Maintenance. Expenditures during turnarounds or at other times for improving, replacing or adding to assets are capitalized. Expenditures for the acquisition, construction or development of new assets to maintain operating capacity, or to comply with environmental, health, safety or other regulations, are also capitalized. Costs of general maintenance and repairs are expensed. The East Dubuque Facility and Pasadena Facility require a planned maintenance turnaround every two years. Turnarounds at the East Dubuque Facility generally last between 18 and 25 days, and turnarounds at the Pasadena Facility generally last between 14 and 25 days. We intend to alternate the year in which a turnaround occurs at each facility, so that both facilities do not experience a turnaround in the same year. As a result, the facilities incur turnaround expenses which represent the cost of shutting down the plants for planned maintenance. Such costs are expensed as incurred. In many cases, the East Dubuque Facility and the Pasadena Facility also perform significant maintenance capital projects at the plants during a turnaround to minimize disruption to operations. Such projects are capitalized as property, plant and equipment rather than expensed as turnaround costs.  Examples of maintenance capital projects include the installation of additional components and projects that increase an asset's useful life, increase the quantity or quality of the product manufactured or create efficiencies in the production process. Major turnaround costs, which are expensed, include gas, electric and other shutdown and startup costs, labor, contractor and materials costs used to complete non-capital activities such as opening, dismantling, inspecting and reassembling major vessels, testing pressure and safety devices, cleaning or hydro-jetting major exchangers, replacing gaskets, repacking valves, checking instrument calibration and performing mechanical integrity inspections, all of which are completed with the goal of improving reliability and likelihood for continuous operation until the next turnaround.  Acquisition Method of Accounting.  We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired, liabilities assumed and earn-out consideration be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The earn-out consideration will be measured at each reporting date with changes in its fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.  Business Segments  Prior to the closing of the Agrifos Acquisition, we operated in two business segments. After the closing of the Agrifos Acquisition, we now operate in three business segments described below. The operations of the Pasadena Facility are only included in our historical results of operations from the date of the closing of the Agrifos Acquisition, which was November 1, 2012.           &#149;      East Dubuque &#150; The operations of the East Dubuque Facility, which produces primarily ammonia and UAN.             &#149;      Pasadena &#150; The operations of the Pasadena Facility, which produces primarily ammonium sulfate. This is the new business segment.             &#149;      Alternative Energy &#150; Develops projects and markets licenses that would use processes for conversion of low value, carbon bearing solids or gases into valuable hydrocarbons and electric power.   On February 1, 2012, our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from September 30 to December 31. The statement of operations for calendar year ended December 31, 2011 was derived by deducting the statement of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2010 from the statement of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 and then adding the statement of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2011. The statements of operations for calendar year ended December 31, 2011 and the three months ended December 31, 2010, while not required, are presented for comparison purposes.     50          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements                                     For the Calendar Years Ended  December 31,              2012         2011                       (unaudited)              (in thousands)          Revenues:                       East Dubuque      $   224,205         $   199,909        Pasadena         37,430            &#151;        Alternative energy         290            206                                Total revenues      $   261,925         $   200,115                                Gross profit (loss):                       East Dubuque      $   133,543         $   85,998        Pasadena         (1,704   )         &#151;        Alternative energy         80            7                                Total gross profit      $   131,919         $   86,005                                Operating income (loss):                       East Dubuque      $   125,984         $   77,918        Pasadena         (2,648   )         &#151;        Alternative energy         (68,219   )         (105,127   )                             Total operating income      $   55,117         $   (27,209   )                             Net income (loss):                       East Dubuque      $   123,721         $   45,700        Pasadena         (2,648   )         &#151;        Alternative energy         (79,316   )         (109,296   )                             Total net income      $   41,757         $   (63,596   )                             Reconciliation of segment net income to consolidated net income:                       Segment net income      $   41,757         $   (63,596   )     RNP - partnership and unallocated expenses         (11,844   )         &#151;        RNP - unallocated interest expense and loss on interest rate swaps         (2,226   )         &#151;                                Consolidated net income      $   27,687         $   (63,596   )                           Partnership and unallocated expenses represent costs that relate directly to RNP or to RNP and its subsidiaries but are not allocated to a segment. Such expenses consist primarily of business development expenses for RNP totaling $4.5 million, including the Agrifos Acquisition costs of approximately $4.1 million, unit-based compensation expense of approximately $2.8 million, labor allocations from Rentech of approximately $2.1 million, accounting and tax fees of approximately $1.2 million, legal fees and taxes of approximately $0.3 million each, certain insurance costs of approximately $0.2 million and board expense of approximately $0.1 million. Unallocated interest expense represents interest expense on the New Term Loan, which was used to finance the Agrifos Acquisition. Prior to calendar year ended December 31, 2012, East Dubuque and RNP were considered one entity for financial reporting purposes. Prior to the Agrifos Acquisition, RNP operated as one segment. Many of the partnership and unallocated expenses relate to RNP being a publicly traded entity, which are consistent with the $3.6 million in incremental publicly traded limited partnership costs estimated in the registration statement on Form S-1 for RNP's initial public offering. RNP was a publicly traded partnership for twelve full months in 2012 as compared to 52 days in 2011.

Our East Dubuque Facility is designed to produce ammonia, UAN, liquid and granular urea, nitric acid and CO 2 using natural gas as a feedstock. Revenues are seasonal based on the planting, growing, and harvesting cycles of customers utilizing nitrogen fertilizer.  Revenues were approximately $224.2 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 compared to approximately $199.9 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in revenue for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the calendar year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to increased sales prices for all products and sales volume for ammonia, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume for UAN.   The average sales prices per ton in the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 as compared with the calendar year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 3% and 10% for ammonia and UAN, respectively. These increases were due to higher demand. Grain inventory levels were low which created a higher demand for corn, and therefore higher corn prices. Higher demand for corn and corn prices led to expectations of higher corn acreage during the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 which increased the demand for fertilizer. These two products comprised approximately 87% and 89%, respectively, of our revenues for calendar year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.  Sales volume for ammonia increased as a result of an increase in the amount of product available for sale which was due to production rates being higher in calendar year 2012 as a result of the work performed during the fall 2011 turnaround. Sales volume for UAN decreased as a result of less available product during November and December 2012. During this period, the ammonia plant at our East Dubuque Facility experienced two unexpected outages. Ammonia is upgraded to produce UAN. Production of UAN ceased during the outages, postponing UAN sales into the first quarter of 2013.  Although our East Dubuque Facility's primary product is ammonia, the facility has the manufacturing capability to upgrade ammonia into other saleable products, including liquid and granular urea, nitric acid and UAN. We regularly evaluate selling prices, incremental margins and demand for the various products we sell in order to determine the appropriate proportion of products to manufacture. Liquid and granular urea, UAN and nitric acid are currently selling at a premium to ammonia per nutrient ton. Our recently completed urea expansion project at our East Dubuque Facility will enable us to upgrade more ammonia and thereby increase gross margins based on current pricing trends.     52          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements    Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 consists of sales of excess inventory of natural gas and sales of nitrous oxide emission reduction credits of approximately $1.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 consists of sales of excess inventory of natural gas.   Pasadena  We generate revenue primarily from sales of nitrogen fertilizer products manufactured at our Pasadena Facility and used in the production of corn, soybeans, potatoes, cotton, canola, alfalfa and wheat. The facility is designed to produce ammonium sulfate, sulfuric acid and ammonium thiosulfate.  Alternative Energy    This segment generates revenues for technical services and licensing activities related to our technologies.   Cost of Sales                                    For the Calendar Years Ended  December 31,              2012         2011                       (unaudited)              (in thousands)          Cost of sales:                       East Dubuque      $   90,662         $   113,911        Pasadena         39,134            &#151;                                Total RNP         129,796            113,911        Alternative energy         210            199                                Total cost of sales      $   130,006         $   114,110                               East Dubuque  Cost of sales was approximately $90.7 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 compared to approximately $113.9 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to lower natural gas costs of approximately $11.9 million, purchase of ammonia by barge which resulted in additional cost of sales of approximately $8.3 million in the prior year, turnaround expenses in the prior year of approximately $7.4 million, and an out-of-period adjustment for spare parts which resulted in a credit to depreciation expense in cost of sales of approximately $1.2 million. During calendar year 2011, we sold approximately 20,000 tons of ammonia that were purchased by barge, resulting in a cost for the purchased ammonia much higher than the production cost of such ammonia. Since demand for nitrogen fertilizer in our market generally exceeds the amount of nitrogen fertilizer we can produce, we occasionally purchase product for immediate resale when the price of such nitrogen fertilizer available for immediate resale is lower than our sales price at that time. These sales accounted for approximately $8.3 million in additional cost of sales over production cost. Turnaround expenses represent the cost of maintenance during turnarounds, which occur approximately every two years at the East Dubuque Facility. A facility turnaround at the East Dubuque Facility occurred in September and October 2011. The overall decrease in cost of sales was partially offset by additional expenses in 2012, including the following: higher depreciation expense of approximately $1.7 million, prior to the out-of-period adjustment; approximately $2.3 million of expenses related to the two unexpected outages of the ammonia plant, consisting of $1.0 million of direct shutdown expenses and $1.3 million of fixed costs expensed through cost of sales that would have been inventoried had the plant remained operational; and approximately $1.7 million in lime removal costs.  Natural gas costs comprised approximately 44% of cost of sales for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 45% of cost of sales for the calendar year ended December 31, 2011. Labor costs comprised approximately 14% of cost of sales for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 compared to approximately 11% of cost of sales for the calendar year ended December 31, 2011. Depreciation expense included in cost of sales was approximately $10.7 million and $10.3 million, respectively, for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and comprised approximately 12% and 9% of cost of sales for the calendar years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.     53          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements     Pasadena  Cost of sales primarily consists of ammonia, sulfur, labor costs and depreciation. Ammonia, sulfur and labor costs comprised approximately 49%, 15% and 5%, respectively, of cost of sales for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012. Depreciation expense included in cost of sales was approximately $0.4 million. Cost of sales also includes maintenance expenses. Maintenance at the sulfuric acid plant occurred in November 2012. As a result, we incurred maintenance expenses of approximately $0.8 million. The maintenance was originally scheduled for the first calendar quarter of 2013, but due to two unexpected outages at the sulfuric acid plant, we decided to conduct the maintenance early. As a result of the two unexpected outages, we incurred approximately $0.5 million in additional expenses. The acquisition method of accounting required that the inventory be recognized at fair value as of the closing date of the Agrifos Acquisition. This resulted in the value of inventory, which was sold during the two-month period ended December 31, 2012, being increased by approximately $3.4 million.  Alternative Energy  The cost of sales for our alternative energy segment during the calendar years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was for costs incurred for work performed under technical services contracts.  Gross Profit                                    For the Calendar Years Ended  December 31,              2012         2011                       (unaudited)              (in thousands)          Gross profit (loss):                       East Dubuque      $   133,543         $   85,998        Pasadena         (1,704   )         &#151;                                Total RNP         131,839            85,998        Alternative energy         80            7                                Total gross profit      $   131,919         $   86,005                               East Dubuque  Gross profit was approximately $133.5 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 compared to approximately $86.0 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2011. Gross profit margin was 60% for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 43% for the calendar year ended December 31, 2011. Gross profit margin can vary significantly from period to period due to changes in nitrogen fertilizer prices and natural gas costs, both of which are commodities. The prices of these commodities can vary significantly from period to period and do not always move in the same direction. The increase in gross profit margin during the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily due to an increase in revenues and a decrease in cost of sales as described above.  Pasadena   Gross loss was primarily due to reduced margins due to the write-up of inventory to fair value along with the turnaround expenses at the sulfuric acid plant and expenses related to two unexpected outages of the sulfuric acid plant.  Operating Expenses                                    For the Calendar Years Ended  December 31,              2012         2011                       (unaudited)              (in thousands)          Operating expenses:                       East Dubuque      $   7,559         $   8,080        Pasadena         944            &#151;        RNP &#150; partnership and unallocated expenses         11,773            &#151;                                Total RNP         20,276            8,080        Alternative energy         68,299            105,134                                Total operating expenses      $   88,575         $   113,214                                  54          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements     RNP &#150; Partnership and Unallocated Expenses    Partnership and unallocated expenses represent costs that relate directly to RNP or to RNP and its subsidiaries but are not allocated to a segment. Such expenses consist primarily of the Agrifos Acquisition costs of approximately $4.1 million, unit-based compensation expense of approximately $2.8 million, labor allocations from Rentech of approximately $2.1 million, accounting and tax fees of approximately $1.2 million, legal fees of approximately $0.3 million, certain insurance costs of approximately $0.2 million and board expense of approximately $0.1 million. Prior to calendar year ended December 31, 2012, East Dubuque and RNP were considered one entity for financial reporting purposes. Prior to the Agrifos Acquisition, RNP operated as one segment.  Alternative Energy  The primary reason for the decrease in operating expenses is due to the decrease in operating expenses in the alternative energy segment which was the result of a decrease in loss on impairments of approximately $43.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in extinguishment of liability of approximately $7.9 million.   During the calendar year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded loss on impairments primarily relating to the capitalized SilvaGas patents and goodwill from the acquisition of ClearFuels in the amounts of approximately $8.5 million and $7.2 million, respectively, for a loss on impairments of approximately $15.7 million. During the calendar year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a loss on impairment relating to our project in Rialto, California (referred to as the Rialto Project), our project in Natchez, Mississippi (referred to as the Natchez Project) and our project in Port St. Joe, Florida (referred to as the Port St. Joe Project), of approximately $27.2 million, $26.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively. Other costs primarily include previously capitalized option payments on potential sites and deferred fees on potential financing arrangements.   During calendar year ended December 31, 2011, there was an extinguishment of a liability relating to the East Dubuque Facility coal-to-liquids conversion project which was abandoned during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008. For the years ended prior to December 31, 2011, the liability for the advance for equity investment remained because the potential for another coal-to-liquids project still existed. During calendar year ended December 31, 2011, we adopted a revised project development strategy for the commercialization of our alternative energy technologies, which included pursuing projects that were smaller and required less capital. Coal-to-liquids projects, like the East Dubuque Facility conversion project, no longer fit our development strategy. As a result, the liability associated with this project was reversed.   Operating Income (Loss)                                    For the Calendar Years Ended  December 31,              2012         2011                       (unaudited)              (in thousands)          Operating income (loss):                       East Dubuque      $   125,984         $   77,918        Pasadena         (2,648   )         &#151;        RNP &#150; partnership and unallocated expenses         (11,773   )         &#151;                                Total RNP         111,563            77,918        Alternative energy         (68,219   )         (105,127   )                             Total operating loss      $   43,344         $   (27,209   )                            East Dubuque  Operating income was approximately $126.0 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 compared to approximately $77.9 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher gross profit as described above.  Pasadena    Operating loss was approximately $2.6 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 which was due to gross loss as described above.  RNP &#150; Partnership and Unallocated Expenses  Operating loss was approximately $11.8 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 which was due to operating expenses as described above.   Alternative energy    Loss from operations primarily consists of operating expenses, such as selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, research and development expenses, and loss on impairments. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in loss on impairments, partially offset by the decrease in extinguishment of debt as described above.     55          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements    Other Income (Expense), Net                                     For the Calendar Years Ended  December 31,              2012         2011                       (unaudited)              (in thousands)          Other income (expense), net:                       East Dubuque      $   (2,263   )      $   (32,218   )     Pasadena         &#151;            &#151;        RNP &#150; unallocated interest expense and other         (1,994   )         &#151;                                Total RNP         (4,257   )         (32,218   )     Alternative energy         (10,186   )         (4,163   )                             Total other expense, net      $   (14,443   )      $   (36,381   )                            East Dubuque  Other expense, net was approximately $2.3 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 compared to approximately $32.2 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt and interest expense of approximately $17.4 million and $12.5 million, respectively. The entry into the new 2012 credit agreement and the payoff of the credit agreement entered into in November 2011, or the 2011 Credit Agreement, resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $2.1 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012. In November 2011, the entry into the 2011 Credit Agreement and the payoff of the previous credit agreement, resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $10.3 million. In June 2011, we had a loss on debt extinguishment of $9.2 million relating to a former credit agreement REMC entered into during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to high outstanding principal balances, with substantially higher interest rates, for longer periods of time during the calendar year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the calendar year ended December 31, 2012.  RNP &#150; Partnership and Unallocated Expenses   Other expense, net consists primarily of unallocated interest expense and loss on interest rate swaps of approximately $2.2 million. Unallocated interest expense represents interest expense on the New Term Loan, which was used to finance the Agrifos Acquisition.   Alternative Energy    Other expense, net was approximately $10.2 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 compared to approximately $4.2 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of approximately $3.2 million and a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $2.7 million. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to interest of approximately $3.8 million being capitalized during the calendar year ended December 31, 2011. There was no interest capitalized during the calendar year ended December 31, 2012. As a result of redeeming the convertible notes due in 2013, or the Notes, prior to maturity, the unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs were written off which resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $2.7 million during the calendar year ended December 31, 2012.

Revenues were approximately $63.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to approximately $43.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2010. The increase in revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010 was primarily the result of higher prices paid for our products during three months ended December 31, 2011 and higher ammonia sales volume, partially offset by lower UAN and CO 2 sales volumes.   The average sales prices per ton in the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared with the three months ended December 31, 2010 increased by 34% and 59% for ammonia and UAN, respectively. These increases were due to higher demand caused by a combination of low levels of grain and fertilizer inventories and expectations of higher corn acreage in 2012. These two products comprised approximately 92% and 89%, respectively, of our product sales for three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.  Sales volume for ammonia increased during the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to the comparable period in 2010 as a result of lower inventories available for sale in the fall of 2010 given high deliveries during the summer of 2010. Deliveries in 2011 shifted from summer to fall as a result of strong presales to customers during the summer of 2011 for the fall ammonia application season, whereas, in the prior period, we had fewer ammonia tons presold for shipment in the fall. Sales volumes for UAN and CO 2 decreased due to lower availability of the products during the quarter as a result of the shutdown of the East Dubuque Facility for the fall 2011 turnaround. The net impact of the increase in sales volume of ammonia and the decrease in the sales volume of UAN and CO 2 resulted in a decrease in the total number of product shipments as reflected in the table above.  Although our primary product is ammonia, we have the manufacturing capability to upgrade ammonia into other saleable products, including liquid and granular urea, nitric acid and UAN. During the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we regularly evaluated selling prices, incremental margins and demand for the various products we sold in order to determine the appropriate proportion of products to manufacture. Liquid and granular urea, UAN and nitric acid sold at a premium to ammonia per nutrient ton during each of the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.  Alternative Energy.

Cost of Sales                                    For the Three Months Ended  December 31,              2011         2010                       (unaudited)              (in thousands)          Cost of sales:                       Product shipments      $   34,024         $   26,835        Turnaround expenses         2,957            &#151;        Sales of excess inventory of natural gas         479            &#151;                                Total nitrogen products manufacturing         37,460            26,835        Alternative energy         50            51                                Total cost of sales      $   37,510         $   26,886                               Nitrogen Products Manufacturing . Since the demand for nitrogen fertilizer in our market generally exceeds the amount of nitrogen fertilizer we can produce, we occasionally purchase product for immediate resale when there is an opportunity to do so at a price that is lower than our sales prices. The increase in total cost of sales on all product shipments for the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to (i) higher natural gas costs and (ii) the sale of approximately 12,000 tons of ammonia that were purchased by barge at a cost much higher than the production cost of such ammonia would have been. During the three months ended December 31, 2011, this sale accounted for approximately $5.0 million in additional cost of sales over production cost, $1.1 million of the increase in cost of sales was due to higher natural gas costs and the remaining increase was primarily due to other operating expenses, particularly depreciation expense, as discussed below. There were no sales of purchased ammonia during the three months ended December 31, 2010.  Natural gas costs comprised approximately 47% of cost of sales on product shipments for the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to 53% of cost of sales on product shipments for the three months ended December 31, 2010. Labor costs comprised approximately 14% of cost of sales on product shipments for the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to approximately 12% of cost of sales on product shipments for the three months ended December 31, 2010. Depreciation expense included in cost of sales was $3.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, and comprised approximately 9% of cost of sales on product shipments for each of the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.     57          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements    Turnaround expenses represent the cost of maintenance during turnarounds, which occur approximately every two years. A facility turnaround occurred in September and October 2011. As a result, during the three months ended December 31, 2011, we incurred turnaround expenses of approximately $3.0 million.   Natural gas, though not purchased for the purpose of resale, is occasionally sold under certain circumstances, such as when contracted quantities received exceed our production requirements or our storage capacity. In these situations, which we refer to as sales of excess inventory of natural gas, the sales proceeds are recorded as revenue and the related cost is recorded as a cost of sales.  Alternative Energy. The cost of sales for our alternative energy segment during the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was for costs incurred for work performed under technical services contracts.  Gross Profit                                     For the Three Months Ended  December 31,              2011         2010                       (unaudited)              (in thousands)          Gross profit (loss):                       Product shipments      $   28,632         $   16,127        Turnaround expenses         (2,957   )         &#151;        Sales of excess inventory of natural gas         (121   )         &#151;                                Total nitrogen products manufacturing         25,554            16,127        Alternative energy         2            1                                Total gross profit      $   25,556         $   16,128                               Nitrogen Products Manufacturing. The gross profit margin on product shipments was 46% for the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 38% for the three months ended December 31, 2010. Gross profit margin on product shipments can vary significantly from period to period due to changes in nitrogen fertilizer prices and natural gas costs, both of which are commodities. The prices of these commodities can vary significantly from period to period and do not always move in the same direction. Specifically, the increase in gross profit margin during the three months ended December 31, 2011 was due to stronger average sales prices for our products resulting from a combination of low levels of grain and fertilizer inventories and expectations of higher corn acreage in 2012. This increase was partially offset by lower margins received on sales of approximately 12,000 tons of ammonia purchased by barge as discussed above, approximately $1.1 million in higher natural gas costs, and approximately $0.7 million more in depreciation expense running through cost of sales.  Operating Expenses                                    For the Three Months Ended  December 31,              2011         2010                       (unaudited)              (in thousands)          Operating expenses:                       Selling, general and administrative      $   10,498         $   7,687        Depreciation and amortization         566            573        Research and development         4,202            5,426        Other         76            53                                Total operating expenses      $   15,342         $   13,739                               Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. During the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million or 37%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in accounting and tax services expenses of approximately $1.3 million due to the change in fiscal year end and RNP becoming a public company, and approximately $0.4 million in each of pre-development project expenses and public company expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2011 that we had not incurred during the three months ended December 31, 2010.  Depreciation and Amortization . A portion of depreciation and amortization expense is associated with assets supporting general and administrative functions and is recorded in operating expense. The majority of depreciation and amortization expense originates at our nitrogen products manufacturing segment and, as a manufacturing cost, is distributed between cost of sales and finished goods inventory, based on product volumes.     58          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements     Research and Development . Research and development expenses decreased by $1.2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to our revised alternative energy strategy, which includes a reduction in spending, and approximately 25% fewer operating days for the PDU, which was not in operation during the construction of the Rentech-ClearFuels Gasifier. These expenses are included in our alternative energy segment.   Operating Income (Loss)                                    For the Three Months Ended  December 31,              2011         2010                       (unaudited)              (in thousands)          Operating income (loss):                       Product shipments      $   25,726         $   14,584        Turnaround expenses         (2,957   )         &#151;        Sales of excess inventory of natural gas         (121   )         &#151;                                Total nitrogen products manufacturing         22,648            14,584        Alternative energy         (12,434   )         (12,195   )                             Total operating loss      $   10,214         $   2,389                               Nitrogen Products Manufacturing. The increase in income from operations for product shipments for the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to higher sales prices, partially offset by lower margins received on sales of approximately 12,000 tons of ammonia purchased by barge, higher natural gas costs and higher operating expenses.  Alternative Energy. Loss from operations primarily consists of operating expenses, such as selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, and research and development expenses.  Other Income (Expense), Net                                    For the Three Months Ended  December 31,              2011         2010                       (unaudited)              (in thousands)          Other income (expense), net:                       Interest expense      $   (4,098   )      $   (3,730   )     Loss on debt extinguishment         (10,263   )         (4,593   )     Other income, net         51            52                                Total other expense, net      $   (14,310   )      $   (8,271   )                           The increase in other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to the larger loss on debt extinguishment, which was primarily due to a higher amount of debt issuance costs to write off and the payment of call premium fees of approximately $2.9 million.

Our nitrogen products manufacturing segment provides revenue from sales of various nitrogen fertilizer products manufactured at the East Dubuque Facility, primarily utilized in corn production. The East Dubuque Facility is designed to produce ammonia, UAN, liquid and granular urea, nitric acid and CO 2 using natural gas as a feedstock. Revenues are seasonal based on the planting, growing, and harvesting cycles of customers utilizing nitrogen fertilizer.  The increase in revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 was primarily the result of higher prices paid for our products during fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, resulting from stronger demand for nitrogen fertilizer products during the period. Ammonia sales volumes decreased and UAN sales volumes increased during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 as we upgraded more ammonia into UAN to realize higher gross profit margins.  The average sales prices per ton in the current fiscal year as compared with the prior fiscal year increased by 56% and 49% for ammonia and UAN, respectively. These increases were due to higher demand caused by a combination of low levels of corn and fertilizer inventories and expectations of higher corn acreage in 2011. These two products comprised approximately 88% and 86%, respectively, of our product sales for the each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.  Alternative Energy. This segment generates revenues for technical services and licensing activities related to our technologies.  Cost of Sales                                    For the Fiscal Years Ended  September 30,              2011         2010              (in thousands)          Cost of sales:                       Product shipments      $   98,250         $   99,749        Turnaround expenses         4,490            3,955        Sales of excess inventory of natural gas         546            2,259        Simultaneous sale and purchase of natural gas         &#151;            57                                Total nitrogen products manufacturing         103,286            106,020        Alternative energy         200            692                                Total cost of sales      $   103,486         $   106,712                               Nitrogen Products Manufacturing . The decrease in cost of sales on product shipments for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to lower natural gas prices during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 and unplanned repairs and maintenance costs during the first fiscal quarter of 2010.  Natural gas costs comprised approximately 50% of cost of sales on product shipments for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 compared to 54% of cost of sales on product shipments for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010. Labor costs comprised approximately 12% of cost of sales on product shipments for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. Depreciation expense included in cost of sales was $9.6 million and $10.1 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and comprised approximately 10% of cost of sales on product shipments for each of the fiscal years ended September 2011 and 2010.     60          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements    Turnaround expenses represent the cost of maintenance during turnarounds, which occur approximately every two years. A facility turnaround occurred in September and October 2011 and October 2009. As a result, during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, we incurred turnaround expenses of approximately $4.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively. In October 2011, we expensed additional costs relating to the turnaround.  Natural gas, though not purchased for the purpose of resale, is occasionally sold under certain circumstances, such as when contracted quantities received exceed our production requirements or our storage capacity. In these situations, which we refer to as sales of excess inventory of natural gas, the sales proceeds are recorded as revenue and the related cost is recorded as a cost of sales.  When the opportunity presents itself, we may also sell, to a third party at one location, natural gas that we have purchased or are required to purchase under fixed-price contracts and simultaneously purchase, at a different location and at a lower price, the same quantity of natural gas in order to capture an immediate benefit from the price differential between the two delivery points. We refer to these situations as a simultaneous sale and purchase of natural gas. The sale of gas in conjunction with a simultaneous purchase may be at a price lower (or higher) than the purchase price previously committed under a forward purchase contract, which may result in a loss (or profit) compared to the price required in the forward purchase contract. The natural gas is immediately repurchased at a lower price resulting in a lower cost of sales when inventory is sold. All or a portion of a loss relative to the forward purchase contract may be offset (or a profit increased) by a gain on the simultaneous sale and purchase transaction. None of these transactions occurred during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, and only a minor amount occurred during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010.  Alternative Energy. The cost of sales for our alternative energy segment during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 was for costs incurred for work performed under technical services contracts.  Gross Profit                                     For the Fiscal Years Ended  September 30,              2011         2010              (in thousands)          Gross profit (loss):                       Product shipments      $   81,150         $   29,643        Turnaround expenses         (4,490   )         (3,955   )     Sales of excess inventory of natural gas         (89   )         (255   )     Simultaneous sale and purchase of natural gas         &#151;            (57   )                             Total nitrogen products manufacturing         76,571            25,376        Alternative energy         6            (163   )                             Total gross profit      $   76,577         $   25,213                               Nitrogen Products Manufacturing. The gross profit margin on product shipments was 45% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to 23% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010. This increase was primarily due to higher sales prices, lower natural gas prices during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 and unplanned repairs and maintenance costs during the first fiscal quarter of 2010.  Operating Expenses                                     For the Fiscal Years Ended  September 30,              2011         2010              (in thousands)          Operating expenses:                       Selling, general and administrative      $   28,004         $   28,410        Depreciation and amortization         2,225            1,947        Research and development         30,009            19,641        Loss on impairments         58,742            1,190        Advance for equity investment         (7,892   )         &#151;        Other         523            191                                Total operating expenses      $   111,611         $   51,379                                  61          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.4 million or 1%. Salaries and benefits increased by $0.9 million as a result of annual salary increases and an increase in headcount. Consulting expenses increased by $1.4 million primarily due to consolidation of ClearFuels and increases in consulting expenses related to business development. Stock-based compensation decreased by $3.4 million primarily as a result of reversing previously accrued compensation expense on grants related to the milestones associated with our project in Rialto, California, or the Rialto Project, which will no longer be developed. See Note 4 in our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Rialto Project impairment.  Depreciation and Amortization . The amount of depreciation and amortization expense within operating expenses increased by $0.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 which was primarily attributable to a change in estimated useful life of intellectual property acquired in the purchase of SilvaGas' biomass gasification technology. A portion of depreciation and amortization expense is associated with assets supporting general and administrative functions and is recorded in operating expense. The majority of depreciation and amortization expense originates at our nitrogen products manufacturing segment and, as a manufacturing cost, is distributed between cost of sales and finished goods inventory, based on product volumes.   Research and Development . Research and development expenses increased by $10.4 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 primarily due to the development of the Rentech-ClearFuels Gasifier, for which our portion of the development expenses were expensed as research and development expense. We incur research and development expenses at our demonstration plants and in our testing laboratory in Commerce City, Colorado, where we operate the PDU, and built and now operate the Rentech-ClearFuels Gasifier, and actively conduct work to further improve our technology and to perform services for our customers. These expenses are included in our alternative energy segment.   Loss on Impairments . We had recorded construction in progress and other costs related to the Rialto Project, our project in Natchez, Mississippi or our project in Port St. Joe, Florida, totaling approximately $27.2 million, $29.2 million and $6.4 million, respectively. Other costs primarily include previously capitalized option payments on potential sites and deferred fees on potential financing arrangements. Due to the lack of funding available through the various DOE loan guarantee programs, the higher than anticipated costs estimated to complete the Rialto Project, and the lack of financing for such projects, we decided to abandon the three projects. As a result, we recorded a loss on impairment relating to the Rialto Project, the Natchez Project and the Port St. Joe Project of $27.2 million, $26.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively. The loss on impairment for the Rialto Project represents the total cost of the project. The loss on impairment for the Port St. Joe Project represents the total cost of the project less the elimination of a contingent consideration liability of $1.6 million. The loss on impairment for the Natchez Project represents the total costs of the project less the appraised value of the property, which we own, of approximately $2.5 million. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we determined that one of the sites that we had secured under option, a site which we were evaluating for the Rialto Project, was no longer a viable site. Therefore, at the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we gave notice to terminate the option resulting in the write-off of the previously capitalized option payments of $1.1 million. We also determined that the cost of a feasibility study for the East Dubuque Facility conversion project, which had been recorded in construction in progress, would never be used. Therefore, the cost was written off during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010.  Advance for Equity Investment . This is the extinguishment of a liability relating to the East Dubuque Facility coal-to-liquids conversion project which was abandoned during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008. For the fiscal years ended prior to September 30, 2011, the liability for the advance for equity investment remained because the potential for another coal-to-liquids project still existed. During fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, we adopted a revised project development strategy for the commercialization of our alternative energy technologies, which includes pursuing projects that are smaller and require less capital. Coal-to-liquids projects, like the East Dubuque Facility conversion project, no longer fit our development strategy. As a result, the liability associated with this project was reversed.  Other . For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment was primarily due to the removal of a selective catalyst recovery unit in our nitrogen products manufacturing segment for approximately $0.9 million, which was partially offset by various miscellaneous sales and exchanges of nonmonetary assets totaling approximately $0.4 million.     62          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements    Operating Income (Loss)                                     For the Fiscal Years Ended  September 30,              2011         2010              (in thousands)          Operating income (loss):                       Product shipments      $   74,433         $   24,656        Turnaround expenses         (4,490   )         (3,955   )     Sales of excess inventory of natural gas         (89   )         (255   )     Simultaneous sale and purchase of natural gas         &#151;            (57   )                             Total nitrogen products manufacturing         69,854            20,389        Alternative energy         (104,888   )         (46,555   )                             Total operating loss      $   (35,034   )      $   (26,166   )                            Nitrogen Products Manufacturing. The increase in income from operations for product shipments for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher sales prices and lower natural gas prices during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 and unplanned repairs and maintenance costs during the first fiscal quarter of 2010, partially offset by additional audit and tax fees, administrative agent fees under RNLLC's 2010 credit agreement, or the 2010 Credit Agreement, and sales-based incentive bonuses.   Alternative Energy. Loss from operations primarily consists of operating expenses, such as selling, general and administrative; depreciation and amortization; research and development; and losses and costs relating to the three projects that we abandoned.  Other Income (Expense), Net                                    For the Fiscal Years Ended  September 30,              2011         2010              (in thousands)          Other income (expense), net:                       Interest expense      $   (16,666   )      $   (14,235   )     Loss on debt extinguishment         (13,816   )         (2,268   )     Realized loss, net on sale of investments         &#151;            (1,231   )     Gain on equity method investment         &#151;            1,909        Other income (expense), net         137            275                                Total other expense, net      $   (30,345   )      $   (15,550   )                           The increase in other expense, net for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to the loss on debt extinguishment related to the various credit agreements and the increase in interest expense due to higher outstanding principal balances under the credit agreements.   INFLATION   Inflation has and is expected to have an insignificant impact on our results of operations and sources of liquidity.   RNP's EBITDA   EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest expense and other financing costs, loss on debt extinguishment, loss on interest rate swaps, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization, net of interest income. EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:            &#149;      the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; and             &#149;      our operating performance and return on invested capital compared to those of other public companies, without regard to financing methods and capital structure.   EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA may have material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes items that are necessary elements of our costs and operations. In addition, EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently.  The table below reconciles EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measurement, to net income for RNP.     63          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements                                                                     Year Ended December 31,         Three Months  Ended  December 31,         Fiscal Years Ended September 30,              2012         2011         2011         2010         2011         2010              (unaudited, in thousands)          Net income (loss)      $   27,687         $   (63,596   )      $   (4,098   )      $   (5,884   )      $   (65,382   )      $   (42,262   )     Add back: alternative energy loss         79,316            94,653            14,553            10,208            90,308            47,271                                                                        RNP net income      $   107,003         $   31,057         $   10,455         $   4,324         $   24,926         $   5,009        Add:                                                           Interest income         (45   )         (53   )         (14   )         (13   )         (51   )         (57   )     Interest expense         1,469            12,788            1,947            2,912            13,752            9,859        Loss on debt extinguishment         2,114            19,486            10,263            4,593            13,816            2,268        Loss on interest rate swaps         951                     &#151;            &#151;            &#151;            &#151;        Income tax expense         303            14,643            &#151;            2,772            17,415            3,344        Depreciation and amortization         12,460            10,706            3,287            2,601            10,020            10,544        Other         (232   )         (3   )         (3   )                                                                                                EBITDA      $   124,023         $   88,624         $   25,935         $   17,189         $   79,878         $   30,967                                                                       ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOWS  The following table summarizes our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:                                                            For the Calendar Year Ended December 31,  2012         For the Three Months Ended December 31,         For the Fiscal Years Ended  September 30,                 2011         2010         2011         2010              (unaudited)              (in thousands)          Net Cash Provided by (Used in):                                                  Operating activities      $   70,237         $   (2,544   )      $   13,301         $   36,469         $   (10,930   )     Investing activities         (188,198   )         (9,464   )         (10,323   )         (40,240   )         (23,270   )     Financing activities         22,219            128,277            27,462            70,834            19,229                                                              Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash      $   (95,742   )      $   116,269         $   30,440         $   67,063         $   (14,971   )                                                          Operating Activities  Revenues were approximately $261.9 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 compared to approximately $200.1 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in revenue for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the calendar year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to the Agrifos Acquisition, increased sales prices for all of the East Dubuque Facility's products and increased sales volume for ammonia, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume for UAN. Deferred revenue decreased by $4.0 million during the calendar year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease was a result of a decrease in our Pasadena Facility's deferred revenue by approximately $5.0 million due to completing a high volume of sales, which was partially offset by an increase in our East Dubuque Facility's deferred revenue by approximately $1.0 million. The increase in our East Dubuque Facility's deferred revenue occurred because an unscheduled plant outage at the end of 2012 made us unable to fulfill all fall 2012 product prepayment contracts before December 31, 2012 and the resulting extension of a portion of its fall 2012 product prepayment contracts into the first calendar quarter of 2013.  Revenues were approximately $63.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to approximately $43.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2010. This increase was primarily the result of higher prices paid for our products during the three months ended December 31, 2011. Deferred revenue decreased $13.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2011, versus an increase of $17.0 million during the three months ended December 31, 2010. The decrease during the three months ended December 31, 2011 was a result of a high volume of prepaid shipments resulting from the normal seasonality of our business, and due to the fact that few new contracts were signed during the period, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010. In comparison, the balance increased during the three months ended December 31, 2010 due to signing a significant number of new contracts during the period, partially offset by the fulfillment of product prepayment contracts during the three months ended December 31, 2010.     64          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements    Revenues were approximately $180.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 compared to approximately $131.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010. This increase was primarily the result of higher prices paid for our products during fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, resulting from stronger demand for nitrogen fertilizer products during the period. Deferred revenue increased $19.6 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, versus a decrease of $3.7 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010. This increase in deferred revenue was due to higher prepaid sales prices in fiscal year 2011 than in fiscal year 2010, and also a higher quantity of ammonia and UAN product presold in fiscal year 2011. The increase in revenues and deferred revenue from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2011 are the primary reasons net cash flow from operating activities increased from $20.1 million in fiscal year 2010 to $83.7 million in fiscal year 2011.   Our profits and operating cash flows are subject to changes in the prices of our products and our primary feedstocks, natural gas for the East Dubuque Facility and ammonia, sulfuric acid and sulfur for the Pasadena Facility. Our products and feedstocks are commodities and, as such, their prices can be volatile in response to numerous factors outside of our control. In addition, the timing of product prepayment contracts and associated cash receipts are factors largely outside of our control that affect our profits, operating cash flows and cash available for distribution.   Net cash provided by operating activities for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 was approximately $70.3 million. We had net income of approximately $27.7 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012. During this period, we recorded loss on impairments relating to the capitalized SilvaGas patents and goodwill from the acquisition of ClearFuels in the amounts of approximately $8.5 million and $7.2 million, respectively, which accounted for approximately $15.7 million out of the total loss on impairments of approximately 16.0 million. We entered into our New 2012 Credit Agreement and paid off the outstanding principal balance under our 2012 credit agreement. This transaction resulted in a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately $2.1 million. As a result of redeeming the Notes prior to maturity, the unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs were written off which resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $2.7 million. These two transactions resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $4.8 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012. We also had stock-based compensation expense of approximately $10.8 million. Deposits on natural gas contracts decreased by approximately $2.8 million due to obtaining lines of credit with two natural gas vendors that had previously required prepayment. Accrued liabilities decreased by approximately $23.4 million due to the payment of income taxes of approximately $8.1 million relating to the sale of the 39.2% of RNP outstanding common units in the offering, an approximately $3.1 million reduction in liability for sales and use taxes relating to the PDU and our Pasadena Facility decreasing their accrued liabilities by approximately $9.1 million primarily due to the payment of bonuses of approximately $7.2 million, which was partially offset by our East Dubuque Facility increasing their accrued liabilities primarily from amounts due to customers for recent overpayments and refunds on product prepayment contracts that we chose to cancel.   Net cash used by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2011 was approximately $2.5 million. We had net loss of $4.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2011. During this period, we used a portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay in full the term loans outstanding under our 2011 credit agreement, including approximately $2.9 million to pay the associated prepayment penalty fees. This transaction resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $10.3 million. Accounts receivable increased by approximately $2.8 million due to higher sales volumes in the three months ended December 31, 2011 than in the three months ended September 30, 2011, due to normal seasonality of the business and our facility being down for a turnaround during the second half of September 2011. Inventories decreased by approximately $11.2 million due to a high volume of product sales during this quarter, which was due to the normal seasonality of our business. Deferred revenue decreased by approximately $13.8 million as a result of deliveries on product prepayment contracts being higher than the signing of new product prepayment contracts during the period due to the normal seasonality of our business, and due to the fact that few new product prepayment contracts were signed during the period. Accrued liabilities, accrued payroll and other liabilities decreased by approximately $4.7 million due to a large amount of accruals at September 30, 2011 related to turnaround costs at our East Dubuque Facility and the completion of the Rentech-ClearFuels Gasifier.  Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2010 was approximately $13.3 million. We had net loss of $5.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2010. During this period, we entered into the second amendment to our 2010 credit agreement and repaid a portion of the principal outstanding under our 2010 credit agreement. This transaction resulted in a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $4.6 million. Accounts receivable increased by approximately $7.0 million due to higher sales volume leading up to December 31, 2010 than up to September 30, 2010, due to normal seasonality of the business and due to a large increase in UAN sales prices beginning in October 2010. Inventories decreased by approximately $1.5 million due to a high volume of product sales during this quarter which was attributable to the normal seasonality of our business. This decrease was less than the decrease we typically experience during this period due to low inventory levels leading into the period, caused by unusually high sales volume the previous summer. Deferred revenue increased by approximately $17.0 million due to a significant number of new contracts that were signed during the period, partially offset by the fulfillment of product prepayment contracts during the three months ended December 31, 2010.     65          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements    Net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 was approximately $36.5 million. We had net loss of $65.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011. During this period, we recorded loss on impairments relating to the Rialto Project, the Natchez Project and the Port St. Joe Project of approximately $27.2 million, $26.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively. We recorded approximately $7.9 million for the extinguishment of a liability relating to the East Dubuque Facility coal-to-liquids conversion project, which was abandoned during fiscal year ended September 30, 2008. We also entered into the second amendment to our 2010 credit agreement and repaid a portion of the principal outstanding under our 2010 credit agreement. This transaction resulted in a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $4.6 million. We also entered into our 2011 credit agreement during this period and paid off the outstanding principal balance under our 2010 credit agreement. This transaction resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $9.2 million. These two transactions resulted in a total loss on debt extinguishment of $13.8 million. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, we used $8.3 million of proceeds from our 2011 credit agreement to pay the prepayment penalty fee resulting from the prepayment of term loans outstanding under our 2010 credit agreement. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, accounts receivable decreased by $5.0 million, due to having a high volume of summer sales in fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 which increased the September 30, 2010 balance. Accrued liabilities increased by approximately $7.4 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 due to significant vendor invoices and accruals for turnaround activities at our East Dubuque Facility in September 2011 and the Rentech-ClearFuels Gasifier, as well as for significant capital expenditures during the turnaround. Inventories increased $9.2 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 due to having more summer sales contracts in fiscal year 2010, whereas in fiscal year 2011, it followed the normal seasonal trend of having more fall sales contracts, requiring high inventory levels at September 30, 2011 to fulfill those contracts. Deferred revenue increased $19.7 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011. The increase was due to higher prepaid sales prices in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 than in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, and also a higher quantity of ammonia and UAN product presold in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011.  Net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 was $10.9 million. We had net loss of $42.3 million for fiscal year 2010. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we entered into our 2010 credit agreement, the proceeds from which were used to repay in full the term loan under the credit agreement we entered into in fiscal year 2008, or our 2008 credit agreement. This transaction resulted in a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $2.3 million. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, accounts receivable increased by $0.9 million due to high summer sales volume, mainly resulting from some large shipments by barge. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, we recorded a property insurance claim receivable for insured property losses related to a weather-related shutdown of our facility in January 2009. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we collected the outstanding balance of $1.8 million. Inventories decreased during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 by $4.7 million due to a combination of inventory levels having been high leading into the fiscal year from a seasonal build-up of inventory prior to the fall ammonia application season and reduction of inventories from higher than normal sales volumes during the summer of 2010, mainly due to some large shipments by barge. This was partially offset by higher costs of natural gas associated with product held in inventory. Deposits on natural gas purchase contracts increased by $1.6 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 due to timing of purchases and vendor selection, which impact payment terms. Deferred revenue resulting from product pre-sales decreased $3.7 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 due to timing of cash receipts on fall product prepayment contracts.   Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $188.2 million, $9.5 million, $10.3 million, $40.2 million and $23.3 million, respectively, for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012, the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. In the calendar year ended December 31, 2012, we paid approximately $128.6 million, net of cash received, for the Agrifos Acquisition. The amount for purchase of property, plant, equipment and construction in progress of approximately $59.1 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012 relates primarily to the ammonia production and storage capacity expansion project, the urea expansion project and the DEF build-out. The increase in net additions of $2.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to capital projects completed during the turnaround at the East Dubuque Facility. The increase in net additions of $13.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 was primarily due to capital projects undertaken during the turnaround, which was started in September of 2011, at the East Dubuque Facility and spending for development activities at the Port St. Joe Project.     66          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements    Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $22.2 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012. During the calendar year ended December 31, 2012, RNP had borrowings under its New 2012 Credit Agreement and its 2012 credit agreement which totaled approximately $222.8 million and repaid borrowings under our 2012 credit agreement of approximately $29.5 million. We also redeemed the Notes for cash of approximately $57.5 million and paid distributions of approximately $43.3 million. RNP paid distributions to noncontrolling interests of approximately $47.2 million.  Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $128.3 million and $27.5 million, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. During the three months ended December 31, 2011, RNP completed its initial public offering, which raised a total of $300.0 million in gross proceeds, and approximately $276.0 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $21.0 million and offering expenses of approximately $3.0 million, excluding approximately $1.0 million in offering expenses paid prior to September 30, 2011. We also repaid in full and terminated our 2011 credit agreement, which had an outstanding principal balance of $146.3 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2010, concurrently with entering into the second amendment to our 2010 credit agreement, we entered into a second incremental loan assumption agreement to borrow an additional $52.0 million, with an original issue discount of $1.0 million. We also prepaid $20.0 million of outstanding principal in connection with the second amendment to our 2010 credit agreement, from cash on hand that we had reserved for such purpose, and made $2.5 million in scheduled principal payments.  Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $70.8 million and $19.2 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, concurrently with entering into the second amendment to our 2010 credit agreement, we entered into a second incremental loan assumption agreement to borrow an additional $52.0 million, with an original issue discount of $1.0 million. We also entered into our 2011 credit agreement pursuant to which we borrowed $150.0 million, $85.4 million of which was used to pay off the outstanding principal balance under our 2010 credit agreement. Additionally, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, in addition to $8.7 million of scheduled principal payments, we prepaid $20.0 million of outstanding principal in connection with the second amendment to our 2010 credit agreement, from cash on hand that we had reserved for such purpose, and $5.0 million as a mandatory prepayment in connection with the $5.0 million dividend we received from REMC. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we replaced our 2008 credit agreement, which had an outstanding balance of $37.1 million and issuance costs of $0.9 million, with the net proceeds from our 2010 credit agreement, which had an initial principal amount of $62.5 million. Our 2010 credit agreement was amended on July 21, 2010 resulting in the increase of the principal balance to $67.5 million. Our 2010 credit agreement had an aggregate original issue discount amount of $3.1 million.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   At December 31, 2012, our current assets totaled approximately $191.1 million, including cash and cash equivalents of approximately $141.7 million, of which approximately $55.8 million was held at RNP, and accounts receivable of approximately $9.7 million. At December 31, 2012, our current liabilities were approximately $84.0 million, and we had long-term liabilities of approximately $194.1 million, comprised primarily of the outstanding borrowings under the New 2012 Credit Agreement.   Nitrogen Products Manufacturing  During the next 12 months, based on current market conditions, we expect RNP's principal liquidity needs, including those associated with the ammonia production and storage capacity expansion project and the ammonium sulfate debottlenecking and production capacity project, to be met from cash on hand at RNP, cash forecasted to be generated by RNLLC's and RNPLLC's operations and borrowings under the New 2012 Credit Agreement. These liquidity needs include costs to operate and maintain the Facilities, working capital, debt service requirements coming due within the next year, and maintenance capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2013 are expected to be approximately $16.0 million. The $16.0 million of maintenance capital expenditures excludes the cost to replace the sulfuric acid converter at the sulfuric acid plant at our Pasadena Facility. We intend to begin the project to replace the converter during the third quarter of 2013, and to complete it during 2014 for an estimated cost of between approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million. However, the commencement of this project is subject to the approval of the board of directors of the General Partner. If approved by the board, approximately 60% of the cost of this project would be expended in 2013 increasing our expected maintenance capital expenditures for the Pasadena Facility during 2013. We will need external funding in order to undertake this project. We currently estimate that we will incur approximately $77.0 million in expansion capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2013, comprised of expenditures related to the ammonia production and storage capacity expansion project, the nitric acid project, the ammonium sulfate debottlenecking and production capacity project and the power generation project. We expect that:     67          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements            &#149;      the ammonia production and storage capacity expansion project will cost approximately $100.0 million, and will be completed during the fourth quarter of 2013;            &#149;      the nitric acid project could cost approximately $2.0 million, with approximately $1.6 million expended in 2013, and will be completed during the first quarter of 2014;            &#149;      the ammonium sulfate debottlenecking and production capacity project could cost approximately $6.0 million to complete resulting in increased capacity by the end of 2013; and            &#149;      the power generation project, which was started during 2013, could cost approximately $30.0 million to complete and, if sufficient financing and board approval is obtained, would be completed in the fall of 2014.   RNP currently intends to finance substantially all of the cost of these projects using borrowings under the New 2012 Credit Agreement. The New 2012 Credit Agreement includes a $35.0 million Accordion Facility, which allows us to borrow additional funds from any of the lenders, if such lenders agree to lend such amount, and have such borrowings included under the terms of the New 2012 Credit Agreement. If the lenders do not agree to lend amounts under the Accordion Facility to us, we would need to seek alternative sources of funding for the expansion projects. Depending on conditions in the capital markets, we also may seek external funding, among other things, to finance a portion of the costs of these expansion projects, including financing from the issuance of common units or debt securities by RNP. However, there is no assurance that these sources of capital would be available to us.  The $110.0 million New CapEx Facility will be available for borrowing by RNP until February 28, 2014, and will be primarily used for the ammonia production and storage capacity expansion project. The New CapEx Facility requires amortization payments expected to begin in the spring of 2014. In the first two years of amortization, we must make amortization payments of 10% per year, or 2.5% per quarter, and thereafter, 25% per year, or 6.25% per quarter of the aggregate amount drawn, in each case with the final principal payment due upon maturity.  The nitrogen fertilizer business is seasonal, based upon the planting, growing and harvesting cycles. Inventories must be accumulated to allow for customer shipments during the spring and fall fertilizer application seasons. The accumulation of inventory to be available for seasonal sales requires that working capital be available at RNLLC and RNPLLC. RNLLC's practice of selling substantial amounts of fertilizer products through prepayment contracts also contributes to its significant working capital needs. Working capital available at RNLLC is also affected by changes in commodity prices for natural gas and nitrogen fertilizers, which are the East Dubuque Facility's principal feedstock and products. Working capital available at RNPLLC is also affected by changes in commodity prices for ammonia and sulfur, which are the Pasadena Facility's principal feedstocks.  The $35.0 million New 2012 Revolving Credit Facility may be used for working capital. Any amounts outstanding under the New 2012 Revolving Credit Facility (other than outstanding letters of credit) are required to be reduced to zero for three periods of ten consecutive business days during each year, with each period not less than 60 days apart and with one period in each fiscal year commencing in April of such fiscal year. There currently are no outstanding borrowings under the 2012 Revolving Credit Facility.  The principal amount of the new term loan is required to be paid in equal quarterly installments of approximately $1.9 million on the first day of each fiscal quarter beginning on January 1, 2013.  Borrowings under the New 2012 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin, plus, at RNP's option, either (a) in the case of base rate borrowings, a rate equal to the highest of (1) the prime rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and (3) the LIBOR for an interest period of three months plus 1.00% or (b) in the case of LIBOR borrowings, the offered rate per annum for deposits of dollars for the applicable interest period. The applicable margin for borrowings under the New 2012 Credit Agreement is 2.75% with respect to base rate borrowings and 3.75% with respect to LIBOR borrowings. Additionally, RNP is required to pay a fee to the lenders under the New 2012 Credit Agreement on the unused amount under the New 2012 Revolving Credit Facility at a rate per annum of 0.50% and under the New CapEx Facility at a rate per annum of 0.75%. RNP is also required to pay customary letter of credit fees on issued letters of credit.     68          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements    The New 2012 Credit Agreement expires on October 31, 2017 and requires RNP and its subsidiaries to meet the following financial covenants (and failure to meet such covenants could result in acceleration of the outstanding loans):           &#149;      Maximum Total Leverage Ratio (defined as total debt of RNP and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, divided by Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the New 2012 Credit Agreement)) of not greater than 2.5 to 1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the 12 month period then ending. As of December 31, 2012, RNP's actual Total Leverage Ratio was 0.4 to 1.0.             &#149;      Maintenance of a Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined as (a) Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the New 2012 Credit Agreement) minus unfinanced capital expenditures of RNP and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, divided by (b) the sum of (i) interest expense paid or accrued, (ii) scheduled principal payments and (iii) taxes paid or payable of RNP and its subsidiaries in each case and (iv) cash payments of the Supplemental Purchase Price (as defined in the New 2012 Credit Agreement) for the Agrifos Acquisition) of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the 12 month period then ending. As of December 31, 2012, RNP's actual Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was 57.3 to 1.0.   Depending on conditions in the capital markets, RNP may seek external funding during the next 12 months to refinance its existing indebtedness, fund capital expenditures or supplement its working capital, including financing from the issuance of common units or debt securities. However, there is no assurance that these sources of capital would be available to RNP.  We believe we have sufficient liquidity for our expected funding requirements at RNP through at least the next 12 months.  Alternative Energy  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, we funded our operations in our alternative energy segment primarily through cash on hand and cash from distributions from RNP. We expect quarterly distributions from RNP to be a major source of liquidity for our alternative energy segment. Any distributions made by RNP to its unitholders will be done on a pro rata basis. We will receive 59.9% of RNP's quarterly distributions to common unitholders based on our current ownership interest in RNP. However, our ownership interest may be reduced over time if we elect to sell any of our common units or if additional common units are issued by RNP. On January 23, 2013, the board of directors of the general partner declared a cash distribution to RNP's common unitholders and payments to holders of phantom units for the period October 1, 2012 through and including December 31, 2012 of $0.75 per unit or approximately $29.2 million in the aggregate. We received a distribution of approximately $17.4 million, representing our share of distributions based on our ownership of common units. The cash distribution was paid on February 14, 2013, to unitholders of record at the close of business on February 7, 2013.   During the next 12 months, we expect the liquidity needs of our alternative energy segment could be met from cash on hand and distributions from RNP. Our primary needs for working capital for the next 12 months related to our alternative energy segment are expected to include administrative needs; costs to complete operation and wind-down of the PDU, and to maintain the technology and site; costs to evaluate entry into a new business line and potential investments in a new business line.  In February 2012, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $25.0 million, exclusive of commissions, of outstanding shares of our common stock over the subsequent 12-month period. The share repurchase program took effect in March 20, 2012 and was funded by our available cash. As of December 31, 2012, we had repurchased approximately 9.1 million shares of our common stock under the program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $16.4 million. No shares were acquired subsequent to December 31, 2012 and the share repurchase program has expired.     69          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements    We believe we have sufficient liquidity for our expected funding requirements in our alternative energy segment through the next 12 months.  Potential New Line of Business    We are focused on growth opportunities within the energy industry and are pursuing acquisitions and projects within the energy industry that do not rely on new technologies. We may need additional capital in the event we acquire businesses or assets in a new business line. Such additional capital may be available, if needed, from external financing sources, including from offerings of equity or debt securities.  As of December 31, 2012, approximately $94.3 million aggregate offering price of securities was available to be sold under our shelf registration statement. Capital markets have experienced periods of extreme uncertainty in the recent past, and access to those markets has been difficult. If we need to access capital markets, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. This report shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.   CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS   The following table lists our significant contractual obligations and their future payments at December 31, 2012:                                                        Contractual Obligations      Total         Less than  1  Year         1-3 Years         3-5 Years         More than  5  Years              (in thousands)           Continuing Operations                                                   New 2012Credit Agreement (1)      $   193,290         $   7,750         $   22,201         $   163,339         $   &#151;        Earn-out consideration (2)         4,920            &#151;            4,920            &#151;            &#151;        Natural gas (3)         7,531            7,531            &#151;            &#151;            &#151;        Purchase obligations (4)         21,015            21,015            &#151;            &#151;            &#151;        Asbestos removal (5)         3,128            2,776            &#151;            &#151;            352        Operating leases         2,791            1,299            1,473            19            &#151;        Gas and electric fixed charges (6)         1,917            913            1,004            &#151;            &#151;        EPA penalties (7)         720            720            &#151;            &#151;            &#151;        Pension plans and postretirement plan (8)         206            206            &#151;            &#151;            &#151;                                                              Total      $   235,518         $   42,210         $   29,598         $   163,358         $   352                                                                   (1)   As of the date of this report, there is approximately $207.6 million of principal outstanding under the 2012 Credit Agreement.        (2)   RNP entered into the Purchase Agreement relating to the Agrifos Acquisition which, among other things, provides for the potential payment of earn-out consideration calculated based on the amount by which the two-year Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Purchase Agreement, of the Pasadena Facility exceeds certain Adjusted EBITDA thresholds. The amount reflected in the table reflects our current estimate of the amount of the earn-out consideration we will be required to pay. Depending on the two-year Adjusted EBITDA amounts, such additional earn-out consideration may vary from zero to a maximum of $50.0 million. The potential additional consideration would be paid after April 30, 2015 and completion of the relevant calculations in either common units or cash at the option of RNP.        (3)   As of December 31, 2012, the natural gas forward purchase contracts included delivery dates through March, 2013. Subsequent to December 31, 2012 through February 28, 2013, we entered into additional fixed-quantity forward purchase contracts at fixed and indexed prices for various delivery dates through April 30, 2013. The total MMBtus associated with these additional forward purchase contracts are approximately 1.0 million and the total amount of the purchase commitments are approximately $3.2 million, resulting in a weighted average rate per MMBtu of approximately $3.38. We are required to make additional prepayments under these forward purchase contracts in the event that market prices fall below the purchase prices in the contracts.        (4)   The amount presented represents certain open purchase orders with our vendors. Not all of our open purchase orders are purchase obligations, since some of the orders are not enforceable or legally binding on us until the goods are received or the services are provided.      70          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements         (5)   We have recorded asset retirement obligations, or AROs, related to future costs associated with the removal of contaminated material upon removal of the phosphorous plant at our Pasadena Facility and handling and disposal of asbestos at our East Dubuque Facility and our property in Natchez, Mississippi, or Natchez. The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the cost of such liability increases the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount. The liability is accreted each period through charges to operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset. The obligation at our Pasadena Facility is considered short-term due to covenants in our New 2012 Credit Agreement.        (6)   As part of the gas transportation and electric supply contracts at our East Dubuque Facility, we must pay monthly fixed charges over the term of the contracts.        (7)   The EPA issued in December 2011 a CAFO concerning hazardous waste management and air emissions at the Pasadena Facility which imposed civil penalties of $1.8 million plus interest. Pursuant to this CAFO, penalties of approximately $0.7 million were paid prior to the closing of the Agrifos Acquisition, we were obligated to pay penalties of approximately $0.4 million in December 31, 2012, and we are obligated to pay penalties of approximately $0.7 million by December 31, 2013. All amounts to be paid under this CAFO after the closing of the Agrifos Acquisition were covered by the Seller through adjustment of the purchase price.        (8)   We expect to contribute approximately $109,000 and $97,000 to pension plans and a postretirement plan, respectively, in 2013. We acquired these plans as part of the Agrifos Acquisition.   OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   We currently have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements From Financial Statement Disclosures  For a discussion of the recent accounting pronouncements relevant to our operations, please refer to &#147;Recent Accounting Pronouncements&#148; provided under Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in &#147;Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#148;   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   Interest Rate Risk . We are exposed to interest rate risks related to the New 2012 Credit Agreement. The borrowings under the New 2012 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin, plus at RNLLC's option, either (a) in the case of base rate borrowings, a rate equal to the highest of (1) the prime rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and (3) the LIBOR for an interest period of three months plus 1.00% or (b) in the case of LIBOR borrowings, the offered rate per annum for deposits of dollars for the applicable interest period. The applicable margin for borrowings under the New 2012 Credit Agreement is 2.75% with respect to base rate borrowings and 3.75% with respect to LIBOR borrowings. As of December 31, 2012, we had outstanding borrowings under the New 2012 Credit Agreement of approximately $193.3 million. Based upon this outstanding balance, and assuming interest rates are above the applicable minimum and no interest rate swaps, an increase or decrease by 100 basis points of interest would result in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense of approximately $1.9 million. Historically, we did not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. On April 2, 2012, RNLLC entered into two interest rate swaps in notional amounts which now cover a portion of the borrowings under its New CapEx Facility. The initial forward starting interest rate swap started on September 1, 2012 and will terminate on September 1, 2013. The second forward starting interest rate swap will start on September 30, 2013 and terminate on December 31, 2015. Through the two interest rate swaps, RNLLC is essentially fixing the variable interest rate to be paid on a portion of the borrowings under its CapEx Facility. At December 31, 2012, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability of approximately $0.9 million. An increase of 100 basis points in the LIBOR rates would result in the liability for interest rate swaps decreasing by approximately $0.7 million. A decrease of 100 basis points in the LIBOR rates would result in the liability for interest rate swaps increasing by approximately $0.8 million.   Commodity Price Risk. Our East Dubuque Facility is exposed to significant market risk due to potential changes in prices for fertilizer products and natural gas. Natural gas is the primary raw material used in the production of various nitrogen-based products manufactured at our East Dubuque Facility. Market prices of nitrogen-based products are affected by changes in the prices of commodities such as corn and natural gas as well as by supply and demand and other factors. Currently, we purchase natural gas for use in our East Dubuque Facility on the spot market, and through short-term, fixed supply, fixed price and index price purchase contracts. Natural gas prices have fluctuated during the last several years, increasing substantially in 2008 and subsequently declining to the current lower levels. A hypothetical increase of $0.10 per MMBtu of natural gas would increase the cost to produce one ton of ammonia by approximately $3.50.     71          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements    In the normal course of business, RNLLC currently produces nitrogen-based fertilizer products throughout the year to supply the needs of our East Dubuque Facility's customers during the high-delivery-volume spring and fall seasons. The value of fertilizer product inventory is subject to market risk due to fluctuations in the relevant commodity prices. We believe that market prices of nitrogen products are affected by changes in grain prices and demand, natural gas prices and other factors.  RNLLC enters into product prepayment contracts committing its East Dubuque Facility's customers to purchase its nitrogen fertilizer products at a later date. To a lesser extent, RNPLLC also enters into product prepayment contracts for its Pasadena Facility's products. By using fixed-price forward contracts, RNLLC purchases approximately enough natural gas to manufacture the products that have been sold by our East Dubuque Facility under product prepayment contracts for later delivery. We believe that entering into such fixed-price contracts for natural gas and product prepayment contracts effectively allows RNLLC to fix most of the gross margin on pre-sold product and mitigate risk of increasing market prices of natural gas or decreasing market prices of nitrogen products. However, this practice also subjects us to the risk that we may have locked in margins at levels lower than those that might be available if, in periods following these contract dates, natural gas prices were to fall, or nitrogen fertilizer commodity prices were to increase. In addition, RNLLC occasionally makes forward purchases of natural gas that are not directly linked to specific product prepayment contracts. To the extent RNLLC makes such purchases, we may be unable to benefit from lower natural gas prices in subsequent periods.  Our Pasadena Facility is exposed to significant market risk due to potential changes in prices for fertilizer products, and for ammonia, sulfuric acid and sulfur. Ammonia and sulfuric acid are the primary raw materials used in the production of ammonium sulfate which is the primary product manufactured at our Pasadena Facility. Sulfur is the primary raw material used in the production of sulfuric acid, which our Pasadena Facility produces for both internal consumption in the production of ammonium sulfate and for sales to third parties. During the calendar year ended December 31, 2012, 75% of the sulfuric acid used in our Pasadena Facility's production of ammonium sulfate was produced at our Pasadena Facility. The market price of ammonium sulfate is affected by changes in the prices of commodities such as soybeans, potatoes, cotton, canola, alfalfa, corn, wheat, ammonia and sulfur as well as by supply and demand and other factors such as the price of its other inputs. The margins on the sale of ammonium sulfate fertilizer products are relatively low. If our costs to produce ammonium sulfate fertilizer products increase and the prices at which we sell these products do not correspondingly increase, our profits from the sale of these products may decrease and we may suffer losses on these sales. A hypothetical increase of $10.00 per ton of ammonia would increase the cost to produce one ton of ammonium sulfate by approximately $2.50. A hypothetical increase of $10.00 per ton of sulfur would also increase the cost to produce one ton of ammonium sulfate by approximately $2.50.  Our Pasadena Facility purchases ammonia as a feedstock at contractual prices based on a published Tampa, Florida market index, while the East Dubuque Facility sells similar quantities of ammonia at prevailing prices in the Mid Corn Belt, which are typically significantly higher than Tampa ammonia prices. Because we both buy and sell similar quantities of ammonia, we believe that our consolidated exposure to the fluctuations in ammonia prices is lower than is the exposure to ammonia prices of either of our facilities considered alone.     72          Table of Contents    Index to Financial Statements
